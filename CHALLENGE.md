# Chattermill Frontend Coding Challenge

## Introduction

Instead of building something dull and unrelated to what we do here in Chattermill letâ€™s create a
simplified version of Chattermill product!

So... letâ€™s imagine we are at the very beginning of Chattermill history ðŸ¦•. Recently we conducted
several customer development interviews asking our potential clients how they analyze their
customer feedback (letâ€™s say their product reviews) and what kind of tool could be helpful for
this. We realized we need to build a very simple product that would allow them to see what their
customers are speaking about in their feedback and what emotions they express. We decided
to extract different aspects of our clientâ€™s business mentioned in a product review and simply
display them besides each product review as well as emotions that their customers express
when speaking about those aspects.

We decided to build an MVP with 2 screens:

- Login screen - here our clients simply sign in with their username/password.
- Feed screen - on this screen we show feed of customer feedback with themes and
emotional sentiment displayed besides each product review.

Weâ€™ll discuss the exact functionality of these screens a bit later and now letâ€™s consider our data
model.

## Data model and API

Our data model comprises 2 entities: reviews and themes.

**Review** - is a review of a product/service e.g. app review in the Apple AppStore or Google Play.

Review has the following fields:
- `id` - unique identifier of a review
- `created_at` - date and time a review was created at in ISO 8601 format
- `comment` - text of the review
- `themes` - array of review themes identified by our machine learning algorithms.

Review theme has the following fields:
- `theme_id` - id of the theme
- `sentiment` - emotional characteristic of a reviewâ€™s theme which can be negative
`-1`, neutral `0` or positive `+1`

**Theme** - is some topic related to the business of our client (it can be a product quality, delivery,
payments etc.). Theme has the following fields:
- `id` - theme identifier
- `name` - human-readable theme name

We have a REST API for these entities. Swagger documentation for the API can be found here:
https://frontend-task.production.cloud.chattermill.xyz/swagger/index.html.

##What we need to build

Letâ€™s get to the actual features weâ€™re going to build for our MVP!

You can find the expected design here in Figma:
https://www.figma.com/file/T7mLe1LUF9AvcniYw7feWJ/FE-Challenge

>**Note**: we've already set up a webpack build, added a few initial components, implemented basic routing and added a couple of styled components such as `PrimaryButton`, `Logo` and others to jump start and speed up the development process ðŸš€.

### Login screen
Login screen is a separate route in our app that contains a form with username and password
fields and a login button.

Our server implements JWT authentication and one needs to use /login method in order to
obtain a JWT token to call our API. Please use the following username and password to
authenticate with the server:

Username: `chattermill`
Password: `SuperSecretChattermillPassword!`

Documentation for Login API can be found in our Swagger as well (and you call /login method
from the Swagger of course).

Once you obtain a token you can use it to play around with our API right from the Swagger by
pressing the Authorize button and specifying token in the following format: `Bearer %token
obtained from /login method%`.

>**Note**: our Login API response contains an expiration field and our tokens live only for
1 hour thus you need to handle expiration of a token properly.

To speed up the process and show how we do it, we've already implemented components and markup for this screen. You only need to write the logic.

##### ðŸ’Ž Bonus points:
- show/hide password functionality

### Feed screen
Feed screen consists of the filter panel and the feed itself.

In the filter panel we can add and remove filters. We need to implement a filter by theme.
In a filter user can select one of the human-readable options from dropdown.
When a filter is updated the feed updates accordingly.

The feed is simply a list of components displaying product reviews. Each component in a list
displays a comment field of a product review as well as themes with their sentiment (tip: very
concise way to visualize sentiment is by using emojis).

As you can see from our Swagger docs our API supports pagination, so we need to take care of
pagination on a frontend as well.

##### ðŸ’Ž Bonus points:
- use emojis from Figma
- infinite scrolling

## Non-functional requirements

This coding challenge is an opportunity to show off your development skills and ethics.

Please provide proper tests, readme (on how to build, run and test your code and maybe your design
considerations) and comments (when required) and use all the tools you need to ensure quality
up to your standards.
You can use any libraries/components out there to implement the needed
functionality.

Good luck and LFG!!! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
